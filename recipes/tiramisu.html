    <h1>What Is Tiramisu?</h1>

        cream, an egg yolk-enriched mascarpone filling, and coffee-soaked ladyfingers.

    <h2>Tiramisu Origin</h2>

    <p>
        Tiramisu has Italian origins. The famous Italian restaurateur Ado Campeol is 
        credited with its invention in the 1970s. In fact, he was widely known as "the 
        father of tiramisu." The word "tiramisu" translates to "pick-me-up."

    <h2>Does Tiramisu Have Alcohol?</h2>

    <p>
        Tiramisu usually contains alcohol. Marsala wine is the traditional choice, but this recipe 
        calls for a mixture of strong coffee and rum. If you prefer not to use alcohol, just leave 
        it out. It will still be delicious with just the coffee alone (just make sure the coffee 
        is extra strong).

    <h1>Tiramisu Ingredients</h1>

    <p>Here's what you'll need to make this top-rated tiramisu recipe:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Egg Yolks:</strong> Egg yolks are essential for a thick, rich, velvety smooth filling. Though some traditional recipes use raw eggs, this one doesn't — raw eggs carry the risk of food-borne illness.</li>
        <li><strong>Sugar:</strong> White sugar is cooked with egg yolks and combined with mascarpone to create a sweet, creamy filling.</li>
        <li><strong>Milk:</strong> Milk: Whole milk slightly thins the thick filling, resulting in a spreadable texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream:</strong> Beat heavy cream until stiff peaks form to create an irresistible whipped cream.</li>
        <li><strong>Vanilla:</strong> Vanilla extract adds subtle flavor to the homemade whipped cream.</li>
        <li><strong>Mascarpone:</strong> Mascarpone, a creamy Italian cheese with a smooth texture and fresh taste, is a key ingredient in classic tiramisu.</li>
        <li><strong>Coffee:</strong> Ladyfingers are soaked in strong, spiked coffee — this is what gives tiramisu its signature flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Rum:</strong> Rum is used to spike the coffee that will be drizzled over the ladyfingers. Some Allrecipes community members say they prefer Kahlua.</li>
        <li><strong>Ladyfingers:</strong> Ladyfingers are small sponge cakes that are shaped like thick fingers. If you can't find ladyfingers at your grocery store, you can use pound cake cut into strips.</li>
        <li><strong>Cocoa Powder:</strong> Finish off this decadent dessert with a generous dusting of cocoa powder.</li>
    </ul>
